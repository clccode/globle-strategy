        <p><a href="https://globle-game.com/" target="_blank">Globle</a> is a great game. Its name 
        is a play on the popular word game <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">Wordle</a> 
        but it's quite different.</p>
        
        <p>It will test how well you know geography. However, arriving at the correct answer each 
        day can be a long process. While geography buffs will always do well, consider the math. 
        Globle has 196 countries (note that Globle includes Taiwan as a possible answer). That gives 
        you about a .05% chance of guessing it right on the first try. Those aren't good odds.
        </p>

        <p>It helps to think in terms of probability in order to help you more quickly get the right 
        answer. Here is the breakdown of the number of countries in the world by region:
            <ul>
                <li>Africa: 54 countries</li>
                <li>Asia: 49 countries</li>
                <li>Europe: 44 countries</li>
                <li>Latin America & the Caribbean: 33 countries</li>
                <li>Oceania: 14 countries</li>
                <li>North America: 2 countries</li>
            </ul>
        Notice where the majority of the countries are. Fifty-four (27.5%) of the 
        world's countries are in Africa. Forty-nine (25%) of the countries are in 
        Asia (note: that includes the Middle East region). Europe has 44 countries, or 22.4% of the 
        total. That gives you a clue where to make your first guess.
        </p>

        <p>With a slightly better than 1 in 4 chance that the answer is in Africa, that is a good continent 
        to draw your first guess from. Asia, with a 1 in 4 chance of having the solution, is also a good
        choice. Both have a lot of countries, so if the answer you put in shows the answer is still > 5000 
        km away, it's likely that the solution is in another region/continent.
        </p>

        <h3>A recent example</h3>
        <p>Here is how I solved Globle on June 16, 2022:
            <ul>
                <li>1st guess: Tunisia (2140 km from the solution)</li>
                <li>2nd guess: Eritrea (1340 km from the solution)</li>
                <li>3rd guess: Central African Republic (farther, no km given if further from the answer)</li>
                <li>4th guess: Kenya (also further from the solution)</li>
            </ul>
        
        Given I started in North Africa, my 2nd guess of Eritrea was closer to the solution, 
        and my 3rd and 4th guesses in sub-Saharan Africa were further from the solution, I 
        figured it was time to move to a different region. Given the first guess, Tunisia, 
        was 2140 km from the solution, I guessed the solution was likely in the Middle
        East (Asia). Here's how I continued:

            <ul>
                <li>5th guess: Syria (< 10 km from the solution). This tells me the answer is a country
                that borders Syria.</li>
                <li>6th guess: Israel--the correct answer!</li>
            </ul>
        Getting the correct answer in 6 guesses isn't bad, but it was not a given.
        </p>

        <p id="map-look">Take a look at the map of Syria below:</p>

        <img src="./resources/syria-map_1.jpg" alt="Syria Map" id="syria-map">
        
        <p>Looking at the mape you see I had 5 countries to choose from: Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, 
        Iraq, and Turkey. There was a 1 in 5 chance of getting it right (20%) and I made the right
        choice. It also could have gone the other way, having to make four more guesses until I 
        found the answer.
        </p>

        <p>Once you narrow it down to a country nearby is when your knowledge of geography comes into play. Africa, for 
        example, has 54 countries and it is hard to know exactly where they all are. Also, if the solution 
        is one of the small Pacific or Caribbean islands it might take a lot of turns to find the right 
        answer. That's what makes the game so challenging.
        </p>

        <p>I hope this quick guide is helpful. Globle is a difficult, but fun, game to play. Keep at 
        it and you will find your geography skills will improve. Have fun!
