                        <p><a href="https://globle-game.com/" target="_blank">Globle</a> is a great game. Its name 
                            is a play on the popular word game <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">Wordle</a> 
                            but it's quite different.</p>
            
                            <p>It will test how well you know geography and arriving at the correct answer each 
                            day can be a long process.</p>
            
                            <h3>How to play</h3>
            
                            <p>To start playing, first go to the <a href="https://globle-game.com">Globle</a> site. 
                            From there you'll be at the home screen and you will see something like this:
                            
                                <img src="./resources/start_screen2.jpeg" alt="start screen" id="start-screen">
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>As the screen says, just tap the globe to play. From there, you will start entering
                            country names until you land on the right one. Here's how the screen looks:
                                <img src="./resources/game_screen.jpeg" alt="main game screen" id="game-screen">
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>As you select countries, the country you select will be shaded according to how close 
                            your guess is. The darker the shade of red, the closer you are to the answer:
                                <img src="./resources/colors.jpeg" alt="color shades" id="color-screen">
                            </p> 
                            
                            <p>Once you select the correct country, here is what you see at the top of the screen 
                            (note: this game was played on a different day than the image above):
            
                            <img src="./resources/success.jpeg" alt="success" id="success">
            
                            While the concept of the game is simple, the process of finding the correct 
                            answer can be difficult.
                            </p>
            
                            <h3>It's geography, but it's math too</h3>
                            
                            <p>While geography buffs will always do well, it also helps to consider the math. 
                            Globle has 196 countries (note that Globle includes Taiwan as a possible answer). That gives 
                            you about a .05% chance of guessing it right on the first try. Those aren't good odds.
                            </p>
            
                            <p>It helps to think in terms of probability in order to help you more quickly get the right 
                            answer. Here is the breakdown of the number of countries in the world by region:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Africa: 54 countries</li>
                                    <li>Asia: 49 countries</li>
                                    <li>Europe: 44 countries</li>
                                    <li>Latin America & the Caribbean: 33 countries</li>
                                    <li>Oceania: 14 countries</li>
                                    <li>North America: 2 countries</li>
                                </ul>
                            Notice where the majority of the countries are. Fifty-four (27.5%) of the 
                            world's countries are in Africa. Forty-nine (25%) of the countries are in 
                            Asia (note: that includes the Middle East region). Europe has 44 countries, or 22.4% of the 
                            total. That gives you a clue where to make your first guess.
                            </p>
            
                            <p>With a slightly better than 1 in 4 chance that the answer is in Africa, that is a good continent 
                            to draw your first guess from. Asia, with a 1 in 4 chance of having the solution, is also a good
                            choice. Both have a lot of countries, so if the answer you put in shows the answer is still > 5000 
                            km away, it's likely that the solution is in another region. How far away the solution is 
                            will guide you in your next selection.
                            </p>
            
                            <h3>A recent example</h3>
                            <p>Here is how I solved Globle on June 16, 2022:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>1st guess: Tunisia (2140 km, or ~1330 mi, from the solution)</li>
                                    <li>2nd guess: Eritrea (closer: 1340 km, or ~833 mi, from the solution)</li>
                                    <li>3rd guess: Central African Republic (too far: no km given if the distance is greater than your closest guess)</li>
                                    <li>4th guess: Kenya (also farther away than my closest guess)</li>
                                </ul>
                            
                            <p>I started in North Africa and my 2nd guess of Eritrea was even closer to the solution. 
                            Then my 3rd and 4th guesses in sub-Saharan Africa were further from the solution. 
                            At that point I figured it was time to move to a different region. Given the first guess, Tunisia, 
                            was 2140 km from the solution, I guessed the solution was likely in the Middle
                            East (Asia). Here's how I continued:</p>
            
                                <ul>
                                    <li>5th guess: Syria (< 10 km from the solution). This tells me the answer is a country
                                    that borders Syria.</li>
                                    <li>6th guess: Israel--the correct answer!</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p>Getting the correct answer in 6 guesses isn't bad, but it was not automatic either.</p>
            
                            <p id="map-look">Take a look at the map of Syria below:</p>
            
                            <img src="./resources/syria-map_1.jpg" alt="Syria Map" id="syria-map">
                            
                            <p>I had 5 countries to choose from: Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, 
                            Iraq, and Turkey. There was a 1 in 5 chance of getting it right (20%) and I made the right
                            choice. It also could have gone the other way, having to make four more guesses until I 
                            found the answer.
                            </p>
            
                            <p>Once you narrow it down to a country nearby is when your knowledge of geography comes into play. Africa, for 
                            example, has 54 countries so finding the answer is still difficult without solid geographical knowledge
                            of the continent. Also, if the solution is one of the Pacific or Caribbean islands it might take a lot of turns to 
                            find the right answer if you're not familiar with those regions. That's what makes the game so challenging.
                            </p>
            
                            <p>I hope this quick guide is helpful. Globle is a difficult, but fun, game to play. Keep at 
                            it and your geography skills will improve. Have fun!
